# Ansible architecture on Ansible controller & Agent node/s 


![](renamed.jpg)

* Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Its architecture is relatively straightforward:

**What is Ansible's architecture?**
*Ansible's architecture is a system designed for automation, primarily used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation in IT environments.

**Where does Ansible operate?**
* Ansible operates on a controller node, which is typically a machine where Ansible is installed and from where tasks and playbooks are executed. It interacts with managed nodes, which are the machines or devices that Ansible manages and automates tasks on.

**How does Ansible work?**
* Ansible works by executing tasks and playbooks defined in YAML format on managed nodes via SSH connections. It communicates with the managed nodes to gather information using facts and then executes tasks using modules, which are standalone scripts.

**Why use Ansible's architecture?**
Ansible's architecture provides a simple, agentless, and efficient way to automate IT tasks. It allows for easy scaling, configuration management, and deployment across diverse environments. By using Ansible, organizations can streamline operations, improve consistency, and reduce manual intervention, leading to increased productivity and reliability in IT infrastructure management.
